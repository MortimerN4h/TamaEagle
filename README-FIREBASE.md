# TamaEagle Firebase Migration

## Overview
This document describes the changes made to convert TamaEagle from a dual database system (MySQL and Firebase Firestore) to using only Firebase Firestore.

## Files Updated

### Configuration
- `includes/config.php`: Removed MySQL connection and fallback logic, updated to exclusively use Firebase Firestore.
  - Removed `$useFirebase` flag and conditional database selection
  - Removed MySQL database setup and table creation code
  - Updated timestamp handling with a custom `firestoreServerTimestamp()` function

### Authentication
- `auth/login.php`: Updated to use only Firebase authentication
- `auth/register.php`: Updated to use only Firebase user creation and data storage

### Views
- `views/inbox.php`: Updated to get task data exclusively from Firestore
- `views/today.php`: Updated to handle date-based task filtering with Firestore
- `views/upcoming.php`: Reimplemented date range queries with Firestore
- `views/completed.php`: Updated to handle pagination with Firestore

### API
- `api/update-task-position.php`: Removed MySQL code and updated to only use Firestore
- `api/update-section-position.php`: Removed MySQL code and updated to only use Firestore

### Tasks
- `tasks/add-task.php`: Removed MySQL code and updated to only use Firestore for task creation

### Client Side
- `assets/js/database-helper.js`: Updated to only use Firebase Firestore without MySQL fallback

## Changes Made
1. Removed all conditional database selection based on `$GLOBALS['useFirebase']`
2. Removed all MySQL connection setup and query code
3. Updated timestamp handling to work with Firestore
4. Reimplemented complex queries like date ranges to work with Firestore
5. Modified client-side database helper to assume Firestore is always available
6. Implemented manual pagination for places where Firestore doesn't support direct SQL-like OFFSET pagination

## Notes
- Firebase Firestore is now the only database system used by the application
- All authentication is handled through Firebase Authentication
- Timestamps are created using a custom helper function that creates compatible Firestore timestamp field values
