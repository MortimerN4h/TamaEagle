# TamaEagle Firebase Migration - Complete Integration Guide

## Overview
The TamaEagle task management application has been successfully migrated from MySQL to Firebase Realtime Database. This document outlines the complete system architecture and testing instructions.

## System Architecture

### 🔥 Firebase Configuration
- **Config File**: `includes/config-firebase.php` - Firebase settings and helper functions
- **Firebase Tasks**: `includes/firebase-tasks.php` - Task management functions
- **Client SDK**: `assets/js/Login/firebase-client.js` - Firebase Web SDK integration

### 🔐 Authentication System
The authentication system uses Firebase Authentication with client-side authentication and server-side token verification.

**Auth Files:**
- `auth/login.php` - Firebase Auth login page with Google OAuth
- `auth/register.php` - User registration with Firebase Auth
- `auth/forgot-password.php` - Password reset via Firebase
- `auth/verify-token.php` - Server-side token verification endpoint
- `auth/create-user.php` - User creation endpoint
- `auth/google-auth.php` - Google authentication endpoint

### 📋 Task Management
Complete CRUD operations for tasks using Firebase Realtime Database.

**Task Endpoints:**
- `tasks/add-task-firebase.php` - Create new tasks
- `tasks/complete-task-firebase.php` - Mark tasks as complete
- `tasks/uncomplete-task-firebase.php` - Mark tasks as incomplete
- `tasks/delete-task-firebase.php` - Delete tasks
- `tasks/edit-task-firebase.php` - Update tasks
- `tasks/clear-completed-firebase.php` - Clear all completed tasks

**Task Functions (firebase-tasks.php):**
- `addTask()` - Add new task to Firebase
- `getUserTasks()` - Get all user tasks
- `getTodayTasks()` - Get tasks due today
- `getUpcomingTasks()` - Get future tasks
- `completeTask()` / `uncompleteTask()` - Toggle task completion
- `deleteTask()` - Remove task
- `updateTask()` - Edit task details

### 🎯 View Pages
All view pages have been migrated to use Firebase:

**Main Views:**
- `views/inbox.php` - All tasks view (Firebase version)
- `views/today.php` - Today's tasks (Firebase version)
- `views/upcoming.php` - Upcoming tasks (Firebase version)
- `views/completed.php` - Completed tasks (Firebase version)

**Backup Files:**
- `views/*-old.php` - Original MySQL versions (for reference)

### 🎨 Frontend Integration
- **Task Management**: `assets/js/task-management.js` - Handles all task CRUD operations
- **Main Application**: `assets/js/main.js` - Core application functionality (vanilla JavaScript)
- **Firebase Client**: `assets/js/Login/firebase-client.js` - Firebase SDK integration

### 🏠 Landing System
- `welcome.php` - Landing page for non-authenticated users
- `index.php` - Smart routing (logged in → inbox, not logged in → welcome)

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Firebase Connection
Visit: `http://localhost/TamaEagle/test-firebase.php`
- Should display "Firebase connection successful!"
- Should show basic database read/write test

### 2. Test Authentication Flow
1. Visit: `http://localhost/TamaEagle/`
2. Should redirect to welcome page if not logged in
3. Click "Login" and test:
   - Email/password login
   - Google OAuth login
   - Registration process
   - Password reset

### 3. Test Task Management
After logging in:
1. **Add Task**: Click "Add Task" button and create a new task
2. **View Tasks**: Navigate through Inbox, Today, Upcoming, Completed views
3. **Complete Task**: Click checkbox to mark task as complete
4. **Edit Task**: Click task to edit details
5. **Delete Task**: Use delete button to remove task

### 4. Test JavaScript Integration
Check browser console for:
- "TamaEagle main.js loaded (Firebase version)"
- "Firebase initialized successfully"
- No JavaScript errors during task operations
